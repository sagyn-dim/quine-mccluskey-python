It is a python implementaion of Quine-McCluskey algorithm which takes as input the number of literals and the minterms and then produces the reduced/optimized sum of product equation, as well as well showing the essential implicants.

How to use the code:
Opent the .txt file called "input.txt", there is already a sample input given as an example. In the first line, type the minterms as integers, other formats are not accepted.
Minterm numbers must be seperated by commas, however do not put a comma in the end.
In the second line type in the number of literals as an integer.
After this procedure run the main program, the output will be shown the file called "output.txt"
